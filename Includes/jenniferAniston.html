                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p> Jennifer Joanna Aniston was born at February 11, 1969, in Sherman Oaks, California, USA.<br>
                        She is an American actress, film producer, and businesswoman.</p>
                    <p> Aniston practices Hatha yoga and Budokan karate. In 2014, she spoke of her Transcendental Meditation practice.
                        The following year, she revealed she has dyslexia, which had affected her education and self-esteem, and that after being diagnosed in her 20s, her outlook toward life changed.
                        She stated, "I thought I wasn't smart. I just couldn't retain anything. Now I had this great discovery. I felt like all of my childhood trauma-dies, tragedies, dramas were explained."</p>
                    <p> Aniston is a Democrat, donating to Barack Obama's presidential campaign and taking part in a fund-raising lunch for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 Presidential campaign.</p>

                <div id="Personal life" class="col-md-10 tabcontent">
                    <h3>Personal life</h3>
                    <p> Aniston was romantically linked to actor Tate Donovan. The couple began dating in 1995, but ended their relationship after two and a half years in 1998.</p>
                    <p> Aniston met Brad Pitt in 1998. Their relationship was widely publicized in the press. She married Pitt, after two years of dating, on July 29, 2000, in a lavish Malibu wedding.<br>
                        For a few years, their marriage was considered the rare Hollywood success.</p>
                    <p> On January 7, 2005, they announced their separation, and finalized their divorce on October 2.
                        During their divorce proceedings, there was intense speculation in the media that Pitt had been unfaithful to Aniston with his Mr. & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, whom he started dating soon after the split.</p>
                    <p> Aniston started a relationship with actor, director, and screenwriter Justin Theroux in May 2011.<br>
                        The following January they purchased a home in Los Angeles's Bel Air neighborhood for roughly $22 million.
                        They became engaged on August 10, 2012 and were married on August 5, 2015 at their estate. They separated at the end of 2017.</p>

                <div id="Career" class="col-md-10 tabcontent">
                    <h3>Carrer</h3>
                    <p> Aniston began working as an actress at an early age with an uncredited role in the 1987 film Mac and Me.
                        Her first major film role came in the 1993 horror comedy Leprechaun. Since her career grew in the early 1990s, Aniston has been one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood.<br>
                        Aniston rose to international fame portraying Rachel Green on the television sitcom Friends (1994–2004), for which she earned Primetime Emmy, Golden Globe, and Screen Actors Guild awards.</p>
